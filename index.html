					<p class="description">So here's the deal Batsy! I've teamed up with my old pal Riddler, Nigma... Whatever that green question mark boy likes to call himself these days... If you ask me, there's not enough room for 2 green suits in Gotham! I digress.. Thing is, we love playing with you Bats, but you just don't like to play with us. And so we thought of forcing you a little. I've taken the liberty of adding a couple of bombs in your mansion and Gotham Hospital. Random, I know, but then again, I'm not very well known for my logic <span class="laugh">HA HA HA HA HA HA!</span> Anywho... the game is simple: answer at least 8 questions right and your ol' butler and the patients live... Answer more than 2 wrong and well.. you get the idea. Remember to smile, Bats! </p>
